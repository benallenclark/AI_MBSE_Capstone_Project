# Module: app/core/lifespan.py
# Purpose: Manage FastAPI startup and shutdown lifecycle events.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

"""FastAPI lifespan context for startup and shutdown events.

Summary:
    Provides a centralized async context manager to handle application
    startup and teardown phases. Ensures consistent initialization and
    cleanup of shared resources, with timing and structured logging for
    observability.

Details:
    - Automatically invoked by FastAPI at app startup and shutdown.
    - Use the startup phase for initializing global resources (e.g., DB pools,
      registries, caches).
    - Use the shutdown phase for releasing resources to prevent leaks.
    - Logs durations and errors to assist with operational monitoring.

Developer Guidance:
    - Store shared objects on `app.state.<name>` for global access.
    - Prefer async-compatible initialization; avoid blocking calls.
    - Log all major lifecycle steps for debugging and visibility.
    - Do not silently ignore startup/shutdown errorsâ€”fail fast and log them.
    - Extend this file only with cross-cutting lifecycle concerns,
      not business logic.

    Args:
        app (FastAPI): The FastAPI app instance being initialized.

    Yields:
        None: Control is yielded back to the FastAPI runtime after startup.

    Behavior:
        - Logs startup and shutdown phases with elapsed time.
        - Use this hook to initialize or release global resources.
