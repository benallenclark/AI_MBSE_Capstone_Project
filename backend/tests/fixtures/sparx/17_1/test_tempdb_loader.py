"""Test: verify that the XMLâ†’SQLite loader builds a valid in-memory database.

Purpose:
    Ensures `load_xml_to_mem` parses a vendor XML export (sample input)
    and materializes the expected MBSE tables in an in-memory SQLite DB.

Why:
    This confirms the ingestion pipeline works end-to-end without disk I/O.
    If this test fails, the parser or schema detection logic is broken.

How it works:
    - Call the loader on `sample_xml_bytes` (pytest fixture provides small XML sample)
    - Query sqlite_schema to confirm core tables were created
    - Verify row counts match known values from the sample XML
